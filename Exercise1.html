        <p>Born in Phoenix, Arizona on the day April 27th 1998 where I lived most of my life. My parents got divorced when I was three years old, I would live with my mom one year and my dad the next. From ages four to eleven I was moving from house to house every year, switching schools constantly. If you look at a map from Phoenix I have at least lived once in every city there and Phoenix is huge. Ive lived in Tempe twice, Apache Junction, Mesa, Chandler, Glendale, Downtown Phoenix, and Queen Creek. It didn't take till we moved to Maricopa where I'll be living till the end of High School.</p>
        <h2 id="title" style="color: rgba(168, 1, 168, 0.774); background: rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.377)">High School</h2>
        <p> I ended up going to Mountain Pointe High School in Phoenix which is a good 28 miles away from my home in Maricopa. It took a 45 minute bus ride every day to get there and back, that's not including the wait for the bus to pick us up or to leave the school. It was such a long ride every day, with too many students attending the school and the classes weren't good at all. So I ended up transfering to the local school in my city which was Maricopa High School. There I spent the rest of my High School years where I did football for 2 years and track for my senior year. I graduated in May 2016 two weeks before the biggest step I have ever taken in my life so far.</p>

        <p>My last days in town I mostly spent with family before I get shipped off to basic training at Fort Benning, Georgia. I got sent to Benning on June 13th 2016 where I got trained to become a Tank Crewman for 18 weeks. After those excruciating and painful weeks of constantly working out plus training finally paid off once I graduated in October, 2016. From there I got stationed at Fort Bliss, Texas where I will spend the remaining time of my career. Fort Bliss is inside the known border city named El Paso and right next to it is Juarez. While in this city I met this beautiful girl named Marlene Saenz, who became my gorgeous wife. I got assigned to <small>2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division, 1-35 Armored Regiment, Alpha Company</small>. I deployed to three different countries with this company and I have had unforgettable memories from them. My first one was to Kuwait where I got redoployed to Syria, and my third deployment was to Poland as a quick reaction force to defend against Russian Forces. That would be my last time going to another country as I got my E-5 Sergeant and seperated from Army on October 16th, 2019.</p>
